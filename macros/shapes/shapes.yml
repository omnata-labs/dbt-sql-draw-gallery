macros:
  - name: is_in_circle_filled
    description: |
      This macro returns a boolean to indicate if the x and y values fall within the bounds of a circle.
      It's colour agnostic so, designed to be used like so:
      ```
      when {{ '{{' }} is_in_circle_filled([150,150],20) {{ '}}' }} then 'yellow'
      ```

      For example usage, see the `blue_sky` model.
    arguments:
      - name: center
        type: list
        description: A list containing the x and y coordinates of the centre of the circle (e.g. [50,75])
      - name: diameter
        type: number
        description: The diameter of the circle

  - name: is_in_oval_filled
    description: |
      This macro returns a boolean to indicate if the x and y values fall within the bounds of an oval.
      It's colour agnostic so, designed to be used like so:
      ```
      when {{ '{{' }} is_in_oval_filled([150,150],20,0.5,1) {{ '}}' }} then 'yellow'
      ```

    arguments:
      - name: center
        type: list
        description: A list containing the x and y coordinates of the centre of the oval (e.g. [50,75])
      - name: diameter
        type: number
        description: The diameter of the oval
      - name: ratio_x
        type: number
        description: How much to squash the oval vertically (e.g. 0.5 means the oval's height will be half of its width)
      - name: ratio_y
        type: number
        description: How much to squash the oval horizontally (e.g. 0.5 means the oval's width will be half of its height)
