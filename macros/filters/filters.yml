macros:
  - name: colour_blurred
    description: |
      Blurs the image by setting each pixel to the average colour between it and it's neighbour.
      For an example in this repository see the simple_rainbow artwork.
      
      Slack-friendly example:
      ```
      update bitmap_pixels set colour = new_pixels.colour
      from (
        select x,y,
        {{ '{{' }} colour_blurred() {{ '}}' }} as colour
        from bitmap_pixels
      ) new_pixels 
      where new_pixels.x=bitmap_pixels.x and new_pixels.y=bitmap_pixels.y;
      ```
  - name: colour_random_from_mix
    description: |
      Returns a random colour based on a set of provided colours and probabilities.
      
      Slack-friendly example:
      ```
      update bitmap_pixels set colour = {{ '{{' }} colour_random_from_mix(colour_mix=[['#68170C',0.6],['#5F0D07',0.2],['#660D07',0.1],['#6A130C',0.1]]) {{ '}}' }}
      ```
    arguments:
      - name: colour_mix
        type: list
        description: A list of mappings from colour to probability. For example, the input [['#110000',0.2],['#660000',0.2],['#ff0000',0.6]] as a 60% chance of returning '#ff0000', and a 20% chance each of returning '#660000' or '#110000'.

  - name: is_near_edge
    description: |
      This macro returns a boolean to indicate if the x and y values fall near an edge (a change in pixel colour).
      
      It can be used to draw a sharp outline around shapes.

      Slack-friendly example:
      ```
      update bitmap_pixels set colour = new_pixels.colour
      from (
        select x,y,
        case when {{ '{{' }} is_near_edge(distance=2) {{ '}}' }} then '#000000' else colour end as colour
        from bitmap_pixels
      ) new_pixels 
      where new_pixels.x=bitmap_pixels.x and new_pixels.y=bitmap_pixels.y;
      ```
      
    arguments:
      - name: distance
        type: number
        description: When an edge is discovered, the number of pixels either side to include. A larger number results in a thicker line.
      - name: interval
        type: list
        description: A list of probabilities for each layer, from inner to outer, to provide a brush effect. For example, a value of [1,1,0.6] would mean that the outer pixel has a 60% chance of being selected
